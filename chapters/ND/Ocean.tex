\section{Ocean part}
\subsection{Implementation}
{\color{red} Density is not taken into account in the code:
it may be assumed as $\rho_a=1$ in the atmosphere: this can be
a source of errors}
\begin{itemize}
\item
In the ocean part, we use negative z grid levels.
$z_0$ is the bottom of the ocean and $z_{M}=0$ is the surface.
\item
We now note $k$ the index such that $z_{k-1} < \delta_{sl} < z_k$.
\item initialization: $e=e_{min}$ and $\theta = 280K$

\end{itemize}
