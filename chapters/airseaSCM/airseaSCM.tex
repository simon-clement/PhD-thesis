We present in this chapter the concepts and equations in
the continuous level which
we will use in the rest of this thesis.
In particular, in Section \ref{sec:airseaSCM_primitiveEquations}
the turbulent primitive equations are derived then
the surface layer particularities are described in Section
\ref{sec:airseaSCM_SL}.
Finally, the models used in this thesis are summed up
in Section \ref{sec:airseaSCM_hierarchy}
before giving the context and objectives of this thesis
(Section \ref{sec:airseaSCM_context_objectives}).
\section{Derivation of the primitive equations with turbulence}
\label{sec:airseaSCM_primitiveEquations}
This section aims to present the so-called
primitive equations, which are used to model
the inner parts of both the atmosphere and ocean.
\subsection{Non-turbulent primitive equations}
We start from the Navier-Stokes momentum equation in a rotating frame:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:airseaSCM_momentumNavierStokes}
\rho \left(\partial_t + \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla \right) \mathbf{U}
= - \nabla p + \nu^m \Delta \mathbf{U} - \rho \mathbf{g}
- 2 \mathbf{\Omega} \times (\rho \mathbf{U})
\end{equation}
where the symbols are given in Table
\ref{tab:airseaSCM_primitiveEquationsSymbols}
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Symbol & Quantity & Unit \\
\hline
$\rho$& {Density} & ${\rm kg}.{\rm m}^{-3}$ \\
$p$   & {Pressure} & ${\rm kg}.{\rm m}^{-1}.{\rm s}^{-2}$ \\
$\mathbf{U}$ & {Velocity}& ${\rm m}.{\rm s}^{-1}$ \\
$\nu^m$ & {Molecular viscosity}& ${\rm m}^{-1}.{\rm s}^{-2}$ \\
$\mathbf{g}$ & {Gravity acceleration}& ${\rm kg}.{\rm m}.{\rm s}^{-2}$ \\
$\mathbf{\Omega}$ & {Angular speed}& ${\rm rad}.{\rm s}^{-1}$ \\
$\nabla$ & {Spatial Gradient} & ${\rm m}^{-1}$\\
$\Delta$ & {Spatial Laplacian} &${\rm m}^{-2}$
\end{tabular}
\caption{Symbols used in Section
\ref{sec:airseaSCM_primitiveEquations}. Bold letters
indicate that the quantity lies in $\mathbb{R}^3$.}
\label{tab:airseaSCM_primitiveEquationsSymbols}
\end{table}
and the \textit{continuity equation} which ensures
conservation of mass:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:airseaSCM_conservationMass}
\partial_t \rho = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{U})
\end{equation}
\myTD{J'ai paraphrasé la thèse de Sophie dans l'itemize}
It is now possible to simplify the two equations
\eqref{eq:airseaSCM_momentumNavierStokes} and
\eqref{eq:airseaSCM_conservationMass} with
some usual approximations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Spherical geoid approximation}:
we assume that the earth is spherical and that the
gravity acceleration is given by
$\mathbf{g} =\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 0 \\ g
\end{pmatrix}$ where $g=9.81 {\rm m}.{\rm s}^{-2}$.
\item \textit{Traditional approximation}:
We neglect the horizontal terms of
$\mathbf{\Omega}$: we assume that
$\mathbf{\Omega} =\begin{pmatrix}
0\\ 0 \\ f/2
\end{pmatrix}$ where $f$ depends on the latitude.
\item \textit{Hydrostatic fluid}:
the pressure gradient balances the gravity force:
$\partial_z p = -\rho g$. We neglect the vertical
acceleration due to pressure and gravity.
This approximation is usually done for large time
scales like the one used in climate simulations.
\item \textit{Boussinesq approximation}
\citep{boussinesq_theorie_1903}:
the density $\rho$ is close to a constant $\rho_0$.
The variation of density $\widetilde{\rho} =
\rho - \rho_0$ is neglected except when computing
the pressure gradient $\partial_z p = - \rho g$.
Despite this approximation being very rough
for the atmosphere, we use it for both domains
to keep some symmetry of our equations.
\end{itemize}
We hence obtain the \textit{non-turbulent}
primitive equations:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:airseaSCM_nonTurbulentPrimitiveEq}
\begin{cases}
	\nabla \cdot \mathbf{U} &= 0 \\
	\partial_t u + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{U} u) &=
	- \frac{\partial_x p}{\rho_0} + \nu^m \Delta u
	+ f v \\
	\partial_t v + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{U} v) &=
	- \frac{\partial_y p}{\rho_0} + \nu^m \Delta v
	- f u \\
	\partial_z p &= -\rho g
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where we noted $\mathbf{U} = \begin{pmatrix}u\\v\\w\end{pmatrix}$.
\paragraph{Stratification}
$\rho$ is given by an equation of state, which only involves
the temperature in our case (in particular, the effect
of humidity (in the atmosphere) and salinity (in the ocean)
are neglected).
A \textit{neutral} stratification refers to a constant 
density along the vertical axis. Since the density is
constant, the temperature does not need to be computed
to integrate in time the wind speed.
\par
On the contrary, in a \textit{stratified} case the
density depends on the potential temperature $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
	\partial_t \theta + \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{U} \theta) =
	K_{\theta, {\rm mol}} \Delta \theta + F_\theta
\end{equation}
where $K_{\theta, {\rm mol}}$ and $F_\theta$ are
the molecular diffusivity and some forcing term.
$\theta$ must be computed jointly with the wind
speed to solve the system
\eqref{eq:airseaSCM_nonTurbulentPrimitiveEq}.

\subsection{Reynolds decomposition}
The solution of the system \eqref{eq:airseaSCM_nonTurbulentPrimitiveEq}
contains very small scales which cannot be solved numerically for
large domains such as the ocean or the atmosphere. It is hence usual
to use the \textit{Reynolds decomposition}, which consists in
separatinig the variables into an "average" part which can be
represented by the numerical schemes and a fluctuating part which
will be parameterized with turbulent closure schemes
(detailed later in \S \ref{sec:airseaSCM_turbulentClosure}).
\par
For $X=u, v, w, p$ or $\theta$, we note
\begin{equation}
	X = \langle X\rangle + X'
\end{equation}
where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ represents a \textit{statistical}
average which satisfies:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\langle X' \rangle &= 0 \\
	\langle \partial_\beta X \rangle &=
	\partial_\beta \langle  X \rangle, ~~~\beta=x,y,z,t \\
	\langle\langle \cdot \rangle\rangle &= \langle \cdot \rangle \\
	\langle \langle X \rangle Y\rangle &= \langle X \rangle\langle Y \rangle
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
using those properties, the Reynolds decomposition of 
\eqref{eq:airseaSCM_nonTurbulentPrimitiveEq} gives:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:airseaSCM_TurbulentPrimitiveEq}
\begin{cases}
	\nabla \cdot \langle\mathbf{U}\rangle &= 0 \\
	\partial_t \langle u \rangle+ \nabla \cdot
	(\langle\mathbf{U}\rangle \langle u\rangle) &=
	- \frac{\partial_x \langle p\rangle}{\rho_0} +
	\nu^m \Delta \langle u\rangle
	+ f \langle v\rangle - \nabla \cdot \langle
	\mathbf{U}' u'\rangle\\
	\partial_t \langle v\rangle + \nabla \cdot
	(\langle \mathbf{U}\rangle \langle v\rangle) &=
	- \frac{\partial_y \langle p\rangle}{\rho_0} +
	\nu^m \Delta \langle v\rangle
	- f \langle u\rangle  - \nabla \cdot \langle
	\mathbf{U}' v'\rangle\\
	\partial_z\langle p\rangle &= -\rho g
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
However, with this decomposition we obtain more unknown than
equations: this is known as the turbulent closure problem.
\subsection{Turbulent closure and kinetic energy}
\label{sec:airseaSCM_turbulentClosure}
To tackle this problem, we now provide additional relations between
$\langle \mathbf{U}' u'\rangle, \langle \mathbf{U}' v'\rangle,\langle \mathbf{U}' w'\rangle,
\langle \mathbf{U}' \theta'\rangle$ and the average quantities
$\langle \mathbf{U}\rangle, \langle \theta \rangle, \langle p \rangle$.
\paragraph{Boussinesq hypothesis}
From the observation that the turbulent term acts like a diffusion
term oriented "down-gradient", the turbulent terms are approximated
with the help of a "turbulent viscosity"
$\mathbf{K}_u \in \mathbb{R}^3$:
\begin{equation}
\langle \mathbf{U}' u'\rangle = - \mathbf{K}_u \cdot \nabla
	\langle u \rangle
\end{equation}
This is known as the \textit{Boussinesq hypothesis}
(\citep{boussinesq_theorie_1897},
different from the Boussinesq \textit{approximation})
The turbulent viscosity can be defined in a lot of different ways.
An important quantity often used is the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE):
\begin{equation}
	e = \frac{1}{2} \left(\langle (u')^2 \rangle + \langle (v')^2 \rangle
	+ \langle (w')^2 \rangle\right)
\end{equation}
in the turbulent closure model $k-\epsilon$,
the turbulent viscosity is then defined by
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{K}_u = C_m \mathbf{l}_m \sqrt{e}
\end{equation}
where $C_m$ is a constant and $l_m$ is a length scale.
The evolution equation for the TKE
is
\begin{equation}
	\partial_t e - 
\underbrace{\partial_z \left(K_e
    \partial_z e\right)}_{\text{diffusion}}
    = P + B - \epsilon
\end{equation}
where $P>0$ and $B$ are terms denoting respectively
the shear and buoyancy production of kinetic energy;
$\epsilon>0$ is the dissipation rate of TKE
into heat.
\par
$P$ corresponds to the energy lost by $u$ by the
term $\nabla \mathbf{K}_u \nabla u$:
in one vertical dimension, we
multiply by $u$ the equation
$\partial_t u = \partial_z (K_u \partial_z u)$.
and express the result in function of the
mean energy $\frac{u^2}{2}$.
This gives (e.g. \citep{burchard_energy-conserving_2002},
where the derivation is done in the continuous and in the
discrete level.)
\begin{equation}
	\partial_t (\frac{u^2}{2})
	- \partial_z (K_u \partial_z(\frac{u^2}{2}))
	= - K_u(\partial_z u)^2
\end{equation}
where $P=K_u(\partial_z u)^2$ is the energy
\textit{produced} by the shear.
\par
A similar treatment with the density
(whose diffusion term is multiplied by $z$ instead of $u$)
gives that the potential energy
is increased or reduced by $B = -K_\theta N^2$ where
$N^2 = - \frac{g\partial_z \rho}{\rho_0}$ is the Brunt-Väisälä
frequency.
The dissipation rate $\epsilon$ can be parameterized by
$\epsilon \propto \frac{e^{3/2}}{l_{\epsilon}(z)}$.
\myTD{source ?}
\par
Finally, the one-dimensional evolution equation for the TKE is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:airseaSCM_TKE_evolution}
    \begin{aligned}
    \partial_t e =
    \underbrace{\partial_z \left(K_e
    \partial_z e\right)}_{\text{diffusion}}
    + \underbrace{K_u ||\partial_z u||^2}_{\text{shear}} 
    - \underbrace{K_{\theta} N^2 }_{\text{buoyancy}}
    - \underbrace{c_{\epsilon}
    \frac{e^{3/2}}{l_{\epsilon}(z)}}_{\text{dissipation}}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\section{The surface layer}
\label{sec:airseaSCM_SL}
The ocean and atmosphere have not been distinguished in equations so far.
We will use a subscript "o" for the ocean quantities and "a" for the
atmosphere quantities.
\par
We call \textit{surface layer} the area close to the ocean surface
such that it responds to a change at the surface with a short
timescale.
We first restrict ourselves to the atmosphere then
present the oceanic surface layer in \S \ref{sec:airseaSCM_twoSided}.
Even if we assumed that \eqref{eq:airseaSCM_TurbulentPrimitiveEq}
describes both of them, the transition between the ocean and the
atmosphere is not straightforward to handle.
In all this thesis, we will assume that the water
surface is flat: this restriction strongly simplifies
the column models, in particular when the space step becomes
smaller than the surface waves.
The free ocean surface is beyond the scope of this thesis:
however, excluding explicitly
the surface layer from the computational
domain (like it will be done in Chapters \ref{ch:ND},
\ref{ch:OceanND}) may lead to
a relatively simple handling of the free surface.
\subsection{Law of the wall and Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory}
For the atmosphere, the ocean surface can be seen as a
rough surface : the wind cannot slip on the ocean which
means that the velocity of the wind is zero
relatively to the surface.
\par
\myTD{copié-collé du chapitre 4:}
\par
In fluid dynamics, the presence of a rough surface makes strong
gradients appear:
due to the no-slip boundary condition
the scales of motion close to the surface are much smaller than
elsewhere in the domain and it is numerically
intractable in most applications
to refine the mesh enough for those small scales.
The models hence exclude from the computational domain
a part of the surface layer, using an adapted boundary
condition.
%
\paragraph{Neutral case}
We first present the case without stratification:
\citep{karman_mechanische_1930} noticed that the
fluids close to rough surfaces present similarities and
propose a universal function based on dimensional analysis.
Von Kàrmàn also states that "the characteristic length
of the flow pattern is proportional to
[the distance to the wall]".
\par
We list below the main features of the surface layer:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the Coriolis effect and the geostrophic forcing are
		neglected (we assume that the effect of the
		proximity to the surface is predominant);
	\item it is well mixed: the governing equation
		is quasi-stationary (the surface layer
		immediately adjusts to the external parameters).
		As a consequence, the flux $K \partial_z u$
		is a constant along the vertical axis.
	\item The vertical profile of $K$ strongly depends 
		on $z$.
		The size of the turbulent eddies at height $z$
		is proportional to the distance to the surface $z$
		(e.g. \cite{kawai_wall-modeling_2012}, see Figure
		\ref{fig:airseaSCM_eddiesDrawing}).
		As a consequence, the turbulent viscosity
		linearly scales with $z$:
		\begin{equation}
			K \propto z+z_u
		\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
We now interest ourselves into the horizontal component of
the speed. We first assume that it is aligned with the
direction of $u$: since the Coriolis effect
is neglected and the turbulence is assumed isotropic,
there is no rotation of the fluid inside the surface layer
and we can assume that $v=0$
with a rotation of the axis reference.
We will use the orientation of the wind speed later.
\par
Let us define \textit{friction scales} $u_\star$
, $z_{u}$ such that $u_\star^2 =
|\langle w' u_h' \rangle|$ and
$z_{u} = z_{u}(K_{\rm mol}, u_\star)$
(see e.g. \citep{schlichting_boundary_1960}
for the choice of $z_{u}$ as a constant
of integration).
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subimport{images/}{EddiesDrawing.pdf_tex}
	\caption{The characteristic size of the eddies
	(in purple) is proportional to the distance to the
	surface. The link between the size of the eddies
	and the logarithmic profile (in orange) is
	the constant flux approximation.
	}
	\label{fig:airseaSCM_eddiesDrawing}
\end{figure}
The law of the wall reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:airseaSCM_LawOfWallProfile}
	u(z) - u(0) = \frac{u_\star}{\kappa} \ln(\frac{z+z_u}{z_u})
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = 0.4$ is the Von Kàrmàn constant.
\begin{remark}
	Generally, the law of the wall
	refers to an expression using
	$\ln(\frac{z}{z_u})$. By using $z+z_u$
	instead of $z$,
	the molecular sub-layer is included
	inside the law of the wall: we can hence
	use the profile of $u$ for small $z$.
	\myTD{ref là dessus ? j'ai que cocoa-wp2}
\end{remark}
\paragraph{Stratified case}
The extension of the law of the wall to stratified
fluids is called \textit{Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory}.
The quasi-stationarity is also assumed for the temperature
and $K_u \partial_z u$ and $K_\theta \partial_z \theta$
are both constants along the vertical axis.
We can define a friction scale $\theta_\star$
for the potential temperature, such that
\begin{equation}
	\langle w' \theta' \rangle = u_\star \theta_\star
\end{equation}
To describe the stratification, the \textit{Obukhov length}
is used:
\begin{equation}
	L_{MO} = \frac{u_\star^3}{g \kappa
	\frac{\theta_\star}{\theta(\delta_{sl})}}
\end{equation}
which is the only characteristic length describing
accurately the effect of the stratification in
the surface layer \citep{obukhov_turbulence_1946}.
$L_{MO}>0$ in stable stratifications
(where $\theta_\star>0$)
and $L_{MO}<0$ in unstable stratifications
(where $\theta_\star>0$).
The neutral case will be recovered
for $L_{MO} \rightarrow \infty$, corresponding
to $\theta_\star \rightarrow 0$.
\par
The difference with the neutral case is then contained
in \text{stability functions} $\phi_m, \phi_h$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	K_u &\propto (z+z_u)~ \phi_m(\frac{z}{L_{MO}}) \\
	K_\theta &\propto (z+z_u)~ \phi_h(\frac{z}{L_{MO}})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We will use the stability functions of
\citep{hogstrom_non-dimensional_1988} defined by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\phi_h(\frac{z}{L_{MO}}) = \phi_m(\frac{z}{L_{MO}})
	&= 1+ \frac{z}{L_{MO}},
	~~~~~ L_{MO} > 0\\
	\phi_h(\frac{z}{L_{MO}}) =
	\left(\phi_m(\frac{z}{L_{MO}})\right)^2
	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{16 z}{L_{MO}}}},
	~~~~~L_{MO} < 0
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where it is easy to check that $L_{MO}\rightarrow \infty$
recovers the neutral case.
To obtain the solution profiles,
the \textit{integrated forms}
of the stability functions are defined as
\begin{equation}
	\psi_x \left(\frac{z}{L_{MO}}\right)
	= \int_0^{\frac{z}{L_{MO}}}
	\frac{1 - \phi_x(\zeta)}{\zeta} d\zeta
	, ~~~~x=u,\theta
\end{equation}
and we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:airseaSCM_MOSTprofiles}
\begin{aligned}
	||u(z)-u(0)|| = \frac{u_\star}{\kappa}
    \left(
	\ln(1+\frac{z}{z_{u}})
	\emphase{- \psi_u\left(\frac{z}{L_{MO}}\right)}
    \right)
    \\
    \theta(z) - \theta_s = 
	\frac{\emphase{\theta_\star}}{\kappa}
    \left(
	\ln(1+\frac{z}{z_{\theta}})
	\emphase{- \psi_\theta\left(\frac{z}{L_{MO}}\right)}
\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory
is extensively used (e.g. \citep{basu_cautionary_2017});
it is however not universally
accepted in particular in very stable stratifications
(see \citep{optis_moving_2014}).
\paragraph{Bulk algorithm}
Using \eqref{eq:airseaSCM_MOSTprofiles} and the values of
$u(\delta_{sl}) - u(0)$ and $\theta(\delta_{sl}) - \theta_s$
it is possible to compute the friction scales
$u_\star, \theta_\star$. It is however not trivial as
$L_{MO}$ and $z_u, z_\theta$ depend themselves on
$u_\star, \theta_\star$.
The so-called "bulk algorithm" are designed for this
task: they generally rely on a fixed-point method:
\begin{enumerate}
\item input: $u(\delta_{sl}) - u(0)$
		and $\theta(\delta_{sl}) - \theta_s$;
\item choose a first guess $u_\star^{k=0}, \theta_\star^{k=0}$;
\item iteratively apply
	\eqref{eq:airseaSCM_MOSTprofiles} (or
	\eqref{eq:airseaSCM_LawOfWallProfile} in the neutral case)
	to compute $u_\star^{k}, \theta_\star^{k}$ using
	$u_\star^{k-1}, \theta_\star^{k-1}$
	in the expressions of $z_u, z_\theta$ and $L_{MO}$;
\item at convergence ($u_\star^{k},\theta_\star^{k} \approx
	u_\star^{k-1},\theta_\star^{k-1}$) return the friction
		scales $u_\star = u_\star^{k},
		\theta_\star = \theta_\star^{k}$ (or only
		$u_\star = u_\star^{k}$ in the neutral case)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Two-sided bulk and entire coupled system}
\label{sec:airseaSCM_twoSided}
In Chapter \ref{ch:OceanND} we will also consider the
\textit{oceanic surface layer}.
The sea surface temperature and the surface currents are often
evaluated below the surface.
Some efforts have been made to correct the satellite measurement.
\myTD{citer des trucs que cite charles ?}.
In \citep{pelletier_two-sided_2021} a bulk formulation which
uses Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) in the oceanic
surface layer is derived.
We follow this idea \myTD{et on en fait quoi ?}

\myTD{Finally, the coupled system with the surface layer is...}
