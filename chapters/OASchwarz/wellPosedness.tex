\subsubsection{Existence of solutions of the
non-linear semi-discrete in space problem}
In \citep{chacon-rebollo_existence_2014},
the existence of unsteady solutions of
non-linear turbulent models for oceanic surface mixing layers is
proven.
The proof relies on three main points:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the existence of a steady-state;
	\item the well-posedness of the linearized problem
	around the equilibrium;
	\item the use of the inverse function theorem;
\end{enumerate}
The method can be generalized to other types of
non-linearities. In particular, we show the existence and
uniqueness of problem \eqref{eq:SWRbulk}
(ignoring the Schwarz iteration indices) close to the
equilibrium state.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The existence of a steady state is discussed in
	Section \ref{sec:OASchwarz_DiscreteStationaryState}.
	\item The well-posedness is discussed in Appendix
	\ref{sec:OASchwarz_appendix_discreteVariationParameters}
	\item the use of the inverse function theorem;
\end{enumerate}
