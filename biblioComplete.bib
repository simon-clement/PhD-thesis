	abstract = {The optimized waveform relaxation (OWR) methods, benefiting from intelligent information exchange between subsystems—the so-called transmission conditions (TCs), are recognized as efficient solvers for large scale circuits and get a lot of attention in recent years. The TCs contain a free parameter, namely α, which has a significant influence on the convergence rates. So far, the analysis of finding the best parameter is merely performed at the continuous level and such an analysis does not take into account the influence of temporal discretizations. In this paper, we show that the temporal discretizations do have an important effect on the OWR methods. Precisely, for the Backward-Euler method, compared to the parameter αc opt from the continuous analysis, we show that the convergence rates can be further improved by using the one αd opt analyzed at the discrete level, while for the Trapezoidal rule, it is better to use αc opt. This conclusion is confirmed by numerical results},

	abstract = {We propose a ﬁnite volume scheme for convection–diffusion equations with nonlinear diffusion. Such equations arise in numerous physical contexts. We will particularly focus on the drift-diffusion system for semiconductors and the porous media equation. In these two cases, it is shown that the transient solution converges to a steady-state solution as t tends to inﬁnity. The introduced scheme is an extension of the Scharfetter–Gummel scheme for nonlinear diffusion. It remains valid in the degenerate case and preserves steady-states. We prove the convergence of the scheme in the nondegenerate case. Finally, we present some numerical simulations applied to the two physical models introduced and we underline the efﬁciency of the scheme to preserve long-time behavior of the solutions.},

	abstract = {We present a new two-step temporal discretization of the diffusion equation, which is formally secondorder-accurate and unconditionally stable. A novel aspect of the scheme is that it is monotonically damping: the damping rate is a monotonically-increasing function of the diffusion coefﬁcient, independent of the size of the time step, when the diffusion coefﬁcient is independent of the variable being diffused. Furthermore, the damping rate increases without bound as the diffusion coefﬁcient similarly increases. We discuss the nonlinear behaviour of the scheme when the diffusion coefﬁcient is a function of the diffused variable. The scheme is designed to maintain any steady-state solution. We present examples of the performance of the scheme. © Crown Copyright 2007. Reproduced with the permission of the Controller of HMSO. Published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Numerical stability issues typically arise because of different time-stepping strategies applied to the coupled PDE system. In particular, the contributing factors include using large time steps, lack of accurate interface ﬂux, and single-iteration coupling. We investigate the stability of the coupled ocean–atmosphere models for various interface conditions such as the Dirichlet–Neumann condition and the bulk interface condition, which is unique to climate modeling. By analyzing a simpliﬁed model, we demonstrate how the parameterization of the bulk condition and other numerical and physical parameters affect the coupling stability and establish stability conditions for different coupling strategies.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the effect of the space and time discretisation on the convergence properties of Schwarz Waveform Relaxation (SWR) algorithms. We consider a reaction-diffusion problem with discontinuous coefﬁcients discretised on two nonoverlapping domains with several numerical schemes (in space and time). A methodology to determine the rate of convergence of the classical SWR method with standard interface conditions (Dirichlet-Neumann or Robin-Robin) accounting for discretisation errors is presented. We discuss how such convergence rates differ from the ones derived at a continuous level (i.e. assuming an exact discrete representation of the continuous problem). In this work, we consider a second-order ﬁnite difference scheme and a ﬁnite volume scheme based on quadratic spline reconstruction in space combined with either a simple backward Euler scheme or a two-step ’Pade´’ scheme (resembling a Diagonally Implicit Runge Kutta scheme) in time. For multi-step time integration methods the proposed methodology leads to complicated expressions difﬁcult to manipulate. To circumvent this issue, an analytical approach based on the modiﬁed equations technique is introduced. Such approach, valid only over a speciﬁc frequency range, has the advantage to account for the impact of the spacetime discretisation while keeping the simplicity of the continuous analysis. We illustrate the relevance of our analysis with speciﬁcally designed numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {We present and analyze a waveform relaxation version of the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann methods for parabolic problems. Like the Dirichlet-Neumann method for steady problems, the method is based on a non-overlapping spatial domain decomposition, and the iteration involves subdomain solves with Dirichlet boundary conditions followed by subdomain solves with Neumann boundary conditions. For the Neumann-Neumann method, one step of the method consists of solving the subdomain problems using Dirichlet interface conditions, followed by a correction step involving Neumann interface conditions. However, each subdomain problem is now in space and time, and the interface conditions are also time-dependent. Using Laplace transforms, we show for the heat equation that when we consider ﬁnite time intervals, the Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann methods converge superlinearly for an optimal choice of the relaxation parameter, similar to the case of Schwarz waveform relaxation algorithms. The convergence rate depends on the size of the subdomains as well as the length of the time window. For any other choice of the relaxation parameter, convergence is only linear.

	abstract = {We proposed a surface ﬂux scheme based on the Monin-Obukhov similarity for ﬁnite volume models. The scheme solves a negative bias existing in conventional surface ﬂux schemes. In the conventional schemes, the model prognostic variables are used as the center point value in the model grid to estimate the surface ﬂuxes even though the variables are volume-averaged values in ﬁnite volume models. The substitutional use of the volume-averaged model variables for the point value results in underestimation of friction velocity and temperature scale and consequent surface ﬂuxes. The underestimation is more remarkable for a thinner layer, namely, higher resolution, and larger roughness length. In the proposed scheme, the model variables are used as volume-averaged quantities. Large-eddy simulation and single-column model experiments on a planetary boundary layer show that the surface ﬂuxes calculated with the conventional scheme are, in fact, smaller compared to those with the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme allows better estimation of not only surface ﬂuxes but also surface atmospheric diagnostics. Improved estimation of the surface ﬂux with this scheme will contribute to improving the reliability of several kinds of simulations (e.g., those related to the atmosphere, ocean, ice sheet, and sea ice). Importantly, its impact becomes even more signiﬁcant for higher-resolution simulations, which are likely to be more sought after in the future.},

With semi-Lagrangian advection the only non-local vertical operations to be evaluated are vertical integrals. An integral operator is derived based on the Galerkin method using B-splines as basis functions with compact support. Two versions have been implemented, one using piecewise linear basis functions (hat functions) and the other using cubic B-splines. No staggering of dependent variables is employed in physical space, making the method well suited for use with semi-Lagrangian advection.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A simplified model of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
of intermediate complexity between a bulk parameterization and a three-dimensional
atmospheric model is developed and integrated to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) general circulation model.
An objective in the derivation of such a simplified model, called ABL1d, is
to reach an apt representation in ocean-only numerical simulations of some of the
key processes associated with air–sea interactions at the characteristic scales of
the oceanic mesoscale. In this paper we describe the formulation of the
ABL1d model and the strategy to constrain this model with large-scale
atmospheric data available from reanalysis or real-time forecasts. A particular
emphasis is on the appropriate choice and calibration of a turbulent closure scheme
for the atmospheric boundary layer. This is a key ingredient to properly represent
the air–sea interaction processes of interest. We also provide a detailed description
of the NEMO-ABL1d coupling infrastructure and its computational efficiency.
The resulting simplified model is then tested for several boundary-layer regimes
relevant to either ocean–atmosphere or sea-ice–atmosphere coupling. The coupled
system is also tested with a realistic 0.25∘ resolution global configuration.
The numerical results are evaluated using standard metrics
from the literature to quantify the wind–sea-surface-temperature
(a.k.a. thermal feedback effect),
wind–current (a.k.a. current feedback effect), and ABL–sea-ice couplings.
With respect to these metrics, our results show very good agreement with observations
and fully coupled ocean–atmosphere models for a computational overhead of about
9 \% in terms of elapsed time compared to standard uncoupled simulations.
This moderate overhead, largely due to I/O operations, leaves room for further
improvement to relax the assumption of horizontal homogeneity behind ABL1d
and thus to further improve the realism of the coupling while keeping the flexibility
of ocean-only modeling.},

	abstract = {The semidiscrete ordinary differential equation (ODE) system resulting from compact higher-order finite difference spatial discretization of a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation, for instance, the reaction-diffusion equation, is highly stiff. Therefore numerical time integration methods with stiff stability such as implicit Runge-Kutta methods and implicit multistep methods are required to solve the large-scale stiff ODE system. However those methods are computationally expensive, especially for nonlinear cases. Rosenbrock method is efficient since it is iteration-free; however it suffers from order reduction when it is used for nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation. In this work we construct a new fourth-order Rosenbrock method to solve the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation supplemented with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary condition. We successfully resolved the phenomena of order reduction, so the new method is fourth-order in time when it is used for nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. Moreover, it has been shown that the Rosenbrock method is strongly A-stable hence suitable for the stiff ODE system obtained from compact finite difference discretization of the nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation. Several numerical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the new method.},

	abstract = {The present paper considers the problem of predicting motionless regions and true plug (constant velocity areas where the stress is below the yield stress) regimes for fully three-dimensional Bingham plastic flows. Numerical solutions are obtained using a finite-element biviscosity formulation. Comparisons are drawn to alternative numerical approximations and a review of common finite elements is made with a view to finding accurate, stable and economical schemes. A number of elements are compared and we conclude that some of the Fortin elements are most useful on the grounds of computational overhead and solution accuracy. These are used to investigate axial flows of a Bingham body in an annulus. Finally, we show that the numerical solutions of the axial flow of a Bingham plastic in a narrow eccentric annulus show good agreement with observations and theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {A one-equation turbulence model is presented, in which the turbulent kinetic energy k is calculated with a transport equation whereas the turbulent length scale l is calculated with an algebraic expression. The value of l depends on the local stratiﬁcation and reduces to the classical κ{\textbar}z{\textbar} scaling for unstratiﬁed ﬂows near a wall, where {\textbar}z{\textbar} is the distance to the wall. The length scale decreases during stable stratiﬁcation, and increases for unstable stratiﬁcation compared to the neutral case. In the limit of strong stable stratiﬁcation, the so-called buoyancy length scale proportional to k1/2N−1 is obtained, where N is the buoyancy frequency. The length scale formulation introduces a single model parameter which is calibrated against experimental data. The model is veriﬁed extensively against laboratory measurements and oceanic data, and comparisons are made with the two-equation k-ε model. It is shown that the performance of the proposed k model is almost identical to that of the k-ε model. In addition, the stability functions of Launder are revisited and adjusted to obtain better agreement with recent data.},

	abstract = {We present a turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) closure scheme for the stably stratiﬁed atmosphere in which the mixing lengths for momentum and heat are not parameterized in the same manner. The key difference is that, while the mixing length for heat tends toward the stability independent mixing length for momentum in neutrally stratiﬁed conditions, it tends toward one based on the Brunt–Väisälä time scale and square root of the TKE in the limit of large stability. This enables a unique steady-state solution for TKE to be obtained, which we demonstrate would otherwise be impossible if the mixing lengths were the same. Despite the model’s relative simplicity, it is shown to perform reasonably well with observational data from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere–Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99) using commonly employed model constants. Analyzing the scaling behavior of the nondimensional velocity and potential temperature gradients, or of the stability (correction) functions, reveals that for large stability the present model scales in the same manner as the ﬁrst-order operational scheme of Viterbo et al. Alternatively, it appears as a blend of two cases of the TKE closure scheme of Baas et al. Critically, because a unique steady-state TKE can be obtained, the present model avoids the nonphysical behavior identiﬁed in one of the cases of Baas et al.},

	abstract = {Schwarz domain decomposition methods are the oldest domain decomposition methods. They were invented by Hermann Amandus Schwarz in 1869 as an analytical tool to rigorously prove results obtained by Riemann through a minimization principle. Renewed interest in these methods was sparked by the arrival of parallel computers, and variants of the method have been introduced and analyzed, both at the continuous and discrete level. It can be daunting to understand the similarities and subtle differences between all the variants, even for the specialist. This paper presents Schwarz methods as they were developed historically. From quotes by major contributors over time, we learn about the reasons for similarities and subtle differences between continuous and discrete variants. We also formally prove at the algebraic level equivalence and/or non-equivalence among the major variants for very general decompositions and many subdomains. We ﬁnally trace the motivations that led to the newest class called optimized Schwarz methods, illustrate how they can greatly enhance the performance of the solver, and show why one has to be cautious when testing them numerically.},

	abstract = {Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is applied to the surface layer of large-eddy simulations (LES) of deep Southern Ocean boundary layers. Observations from the Southern Ocean Flux Station provide a wide range of wind, buoyancy, and wave (Stokes drift) forcing. Two No-Stokes LES are used to determine the extent of the ocean surface layer and to adapt the nondimensional momentum and buoyancy gradients, as functions of the stability parameter. Stokes-forced LES are used to modify this parameter for wave effects, then to formulate dependencies of Stokes similarity functions on a Stokes parameter j. To account for wind-wave misalignment, the dimensional analysis is extended with two independent variables, namely, the production of turbulent kinetic energy in the surface layer due to Stokes shear and the total production, so that their ratio gives j. Stokes forcing is shown to reduce vertical shear more than stratiﬁcation, and to enhance viscosity and diffusivity by factors up to 5.8 and 4.0, respectively, such that the Prandtl number can exceed unity. A practical parameterization is developed for j in terms of the meteorological forcing plus a Stokes drift proﬁle, so that the Stokes and stability similarity functions can be combined to give turbulent velocity scales. These scales for both viscosity and diffusivity are evaluated against the LES, and the correlations are nearly 0.97. The beneﬁt of calculating Stokes drift proﬁles from directional wave spectra is demonstrated by similarly evaluating three alternatives.},

	abstract = {Component coupling is a crucial part of climate models, such as DOE’s E3SM (Caldwell et al., 2019). A common coupling strategy in climate models is for their components to exchange flux data from the previous time-step. This approach effectively performs a single step of an iterative solution method for the monolithic coupled system, which may lead to instabilities and loss of accuracy. In this paper we formulate an Interface-Flux-Recovery (IFR) coupling method which improves upon the conventional coupling techniques in climate models. IFR starts from a monolithic formulation of the coupled discrete problem and then uses a Schur complement to obtain an accurate approximation of the flux across the interface between the model components. This decouples the individual components and allows one to solve them independently by using schemes that are optimized for each component. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method, we apply IFR to a simplified ocean–atmosphere model for heat-exchange coupled through the so-called bulk condition, common in ocean–atmosphere systems. We then solve this model on matching and non-matching grids to estimate numerically the convergence rates of the IFR coupling scheme.},

We focus on fully coupled ocean–atmosphere models that are needed to represent and understand the complicated interactions of these two systems, becoming increasingly important in climate change assessment in recent years. Numerical stability issues typically arise because of different time-stepping strategies applied to the coupled PDE system. In particular, the contributing factors include using large time steps, lack of accurate interface flux, and single-iteration coupling. We investigate the stability of the coupled ocean–atmosphere models for various interface conditions such as the Dirichlet–Neumann condition and the bulk interface condition, which is unique to climate modeling. By analyzing a simplified model, we demonstrate how the parameterization of the bulk condition and other numerical and physical parameters affect the coupling stability and establish stability conditions for different coupling strategies.},

The development of compact ﬁnite-volume schemes is more involved, due to the appearance of surface and volume integrals. While Pereira et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 167 (2001)] and Smirnov et al. [AIAA Paper, 2546, 2001] focused on collocated grids, in this paper we use the staggered grid arrangement. Compact schemes can be tuned to achieve very high resolution for a given formal order of accuracy. We develop and test high-resolution schemes by following a procedure proposed by Lele [J. Comput. Phys. 103 (1992)] which, to the best of our knowledge, has not yet been applied to compact ﬁnite-volume methods on staggered grids. Results from several one- and two-dimensional simulations for the scalar transport and Navier–Stokes equations are presented, showing that the proposed method is capable to accurately reproduce complex steady and unsteady ﬂows.},

Abstract This paper presents a finite volume fourth-order-accurate compact scheme for discretization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in primitive variable formulation. The numerical method of integrating the Navier–Stokes equations comprises a compact finite volume formulation of the average convective and diffusive fluxes. The pressure–velocity coupling is achieved via the coupled solution of the resulting system of equations. The solution of the coupled set of equations is performed with an implicit Newton–Krylov matrix-free method for stationary problems. For simulation of unsteady flows, a standard fourth-order Runge–Kutta method was used for temporal discretization and the velocity–pressure coupling was ensured at each stage also using the matrix-free method. Several incompressible viscous steady and unsteady flow problems have been computed to assess the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method.},

We present an hierarchy of uniformly high-order accurate schemes which generalizes Godunov's scheme and its second-order accurate MUSCL extension to an arbitrary order of accuracy. The design involves an essentially non-oscillatory piecewise polynomial reconstruction of the solution from its cell averages, time evolution through an approximate solution of the resulting initial value problem, and averaging of this approximate solution over each cell. The reconstruction algorithm is derived from a new interpolation technique that, when applied to piecewise smooth data, gives high-order accuracy whenever the function is smooth but avoids a Gibbs phenomenon at discontinuities. Unlike standard finite difference methods this procedure uses an adaptive stencil of grid points and, consequently, the resulting schemes are highly nonlinear.},

	abstract = {Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is used in large-eddy simulation (LES) models as a surface boundary condition to predict the surface shear stress and scalar fluxes based on the gradients between the surface and the first grid level above the surface. We outline deficiencies of this methodology, such as the systematical underestimation of the surface shear stress, and propose a modified boundary condition to correct for this issue. The proposed boundary condition is applied to a set of LES for both neutral and stable boundary layers with successively decreasing grid spacing. The results indicate that the proposed boundary condition reliably corrects the surface shear stress and the sensible heat flux, and improves grid convergence of these quantities. The LES data indicate improved grid convergence for the surface shear stress, more so than for the surface heat flux. This is either due to a limited performance of the Monin–Obukhov similarity functions or due to problems in the LES model in representing stable conditions. Furthermore, we find that the correction achieved using the proposed boundary condition does not lead to improved grid convergence of the wind-speed and temperature profiles. From this we conclude that the sensitivity of the wind-speed and temperature profiles in the LES model to the grid spacing is more likely related to under-resolved near-surface gradients and turbulent mixing at the boundary-layer top, to the SGS model formulation, and/or to numerical issues, and not to deficiencies due to the use of improper surface boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {Les interactions océan-atmosphère jouent un rôle majeur dans de nombreux phénomènes géophysiques comme les cyclones tropicaux ou le changement climatique.De récentes études montrent que les méthodes actuelles pour réaliser ce couplage dans les modèles numériques sont mathématiquement peu satisfaisantes. Comme alternative pour mieux représenter l'interaction entre ces deux milieux, nous proposons dans cette thèse d'appliquer un processus itératif, plus précisément les algorithmes de Schwarz issus des méthodes de décomposition de domaine. Dans notre contexte, les systèmes mis en jeu sont très complexes et nécessitent des simplifications pour être étudiés analytiquement. Ces simplifications nous amènent à considérer un couplage 1D vertical de deux équations de type diffusion. La paramétrisation des phénomènes turbulents dans l'océan et l'atmosphère, et particulièrement à leur interface, fait apparaître des particularités propres à cette application. Une première particularité est de considérer des coefficients de viscosité non constants en espace, et discontinus à l'interface. Une deuxième particularité est de considérer la rotation terrestre, via l'effet de Coriolis. Enfin, une troisième particularité de notre modèle est que les échanges à l'interface sont traités de manière complexe et créent des non-linéarités dans le modèle couplé via les conditions d'interfaces.Nous étudions ce problème, et le rôle des différentes spécificités sur le comportement de l'algorithme, avec divers degrés de complexité, d'abord dans le cadre du problème d'Ekman couplé (problème linéaire) puis dans le cadre non-linéaire. Il est notamment montré que les différentes spécificités inhérentes à ce problème de couplage, encore jamais prises en compte dans des études théoriques, ont une influence non négligeable sur les propriétés de convergence.},

We consider partitioned time integration for heterogeneous coupled heat equations.

In 1D and for implicit Euler time integration, we analytically determine optimal relaxation parameters for the fully discrete scheme. 
Similarly to a previously presented Neumann-Neumann waveform relaxation (NNWR) first and second order multirate methods are obtained. We test the robustness of the relaxation parameters on the second order multirate method in 2D. DNWR is shown to be very robust and consistently yielding fast convergence rates, whereas NNWR is slower or even diverges. The waveform approach naturally allows for different timesteps in the subproblems. In a performance comparison for DNWR, the time-adaptive method dominates the multirate method due to automatically finding suitable stepsize ratios. Overall, we obtain a fast, robust, multirate and time adaptive partitioned solver for unsteady conjugate heat transfer.},

As the CFB has a significant influence on the oceanic circulation, it is crucial to implement it properly in a coupled ocean–atmosphere model. In this study, we first detail the modifications to be implemented into atmospheric models to account for the CFB. In the computation of air–sea fluxes, the relative winds, i.e., the difference between the near-surface winds and the surface oceanic currents, instead of absolute winds have to be used (Modification M1). However, because of the implicit treatment of the bottom boundary condition in most atmospheric models, the use of relative winds also involves a modification of the tridiagonal problem associated with the discretization of the vertical turbulent viscosity (Modification M2). Secondly, we show both analytically and using global coupled simulations that omitting M2 leads to a large underestimation of the surface stress curl response to the CFB and, subsequently, of the coupling coefficient between mesoscale surface stress curl and surface current vorticity. As a consequence, the dampening of the mesoscale activity induced by the CFB is strongly reduced (by a minimum a factor of 2 or more). The practical implementation of the CFB must be done carefully in the atmospheric component of a coupled model in order to avoid a large underestimation of the CFB effect on the oceanic circulation.},

	abstract = {Abstract In 1996, version 2.5 of the Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) bulk algorithm was published, and it has become one of the most frequently used algorithms in the air–sea interaction community. This paper describes steps taken to improve the algorithm in several ways. The number of iterations to solve for stability has been shortened from 20 to 3, and adjustments have been made to the basic profile stability functions. The scalar transfer coefficients have been redefined in terms of the mixing ratio, which is the fundamentally conserved quantity, rather than the measured water vapor mass concentration. Both the velocity and scalar roughness lengths have been changed. For the velocity roughness, the original fixed value of the Charnock parameter has been replaced by one that increases with wind speeds of between 10 and 18 m s−1. The scalar roughness length parameterization has been simplified to fit both an early set of NOAA/Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) experiments and the Humidity Exchange Over the Sea (HEXOS) program. These changes slightly increase the fluxes for wind speeds exceeding 10 m s−1. For interested users, two simple parameterizations of the surface gravity wave influence on fluxes have been added (but not evaluated). This new version of the algorithm (COARE 3.0) was based on published results and 2777 1-h covariance flux measurements in the ETL inventory. To test it, 4439 new values from field experiments between 1997 and 1999 were added, which now dominate the database, especially in the wind speed regime beyond 10 m s−1, where the number of observations increased from 67 to about 800. After applying various quality controls, the database was used to evaluate the algorithm in several ways. For an overall mean, the algorithm agrees with the data to within a few percent for stress and latent heat flux. The agreement is also excellent when the bulk and directly measured fluxes are averaged in bins of 10-m neutral wind speed. For a more stringent test, the average 10-m neutral transfer coefficients were computed for stress and moisture in wind speed bins, using different averaging schemes with fairly similar results. The average (mean and median) model results agreed with the measurements to within about 5\% for moisture from 0 to 20 m s−1. For stress, the covariance measurements were about 10\% higher than the model at wind speeds over 15 m s−1, while inertial-dissipation measurements agreed closely at all wind speeds. The values for stress are between 8\% (for inertial dissipation) and 18\% (for covariance) higher at 20 m s−1 than two other classic results. Twenty years ago, bulk flux schemes were considered to be uncertain by about 30\%; the authors find COARE 3.0 to be accurate within 5\% for wind speeds of 0–10 m s−1 and 10\% for wind speeds of between 10 and 20 m s−1.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the mechanism of atmospheric and oceanic turbulence and the climate, it is necessary to simulate properly the interaction mechanism of the atmosphere and the ocean. As is well-known this difficult problem is considered as one of the Grand Challenges in High Performance Computing and Communication. As a first step for us towards this long range project our aim in this article and two companions articles [LTW3, 4] (also referred to as [CAO I] and [CAO II]) is to derive some mathematical models for the coupling of the ocean and the atmosphere and to study them from the numerical viewpoint as well as from the mathematical viewpoint (existence and uniqueness of solutions, attractors...). The present article is devoted to the mathematical analysis of the Coupled Atmosphere and Ocean Models (CAO models). The companion articles [CAO I] and [CAO II] contain respectively the presentation of the models and their numerical study. The models introduced in [CAO I] are based on the Primitve Equations (PEs) and on the Primitive Equations with Vertical Viscosity (PEVs) of the atmosphere-only and the ocean-only systems. The resulting models are called the Primitive Equations of the Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean (PEs of CAO) and the Primitive Equations with Vertical Viscosity of the Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean (PEV\{sup 2\}s of CAO). Both models are studied here. In order to highlight the main mathematical aspects of the PEs and the PEV\{sup 2\}s of CAO, two simplified models, the simplified PEs and the simplified PEV\{sup 2\}s, are also considered in this article. First of all, we present in this article the variational formulations of the equations, and obtain the existence and time-analyticity of solutions to the equations. We then establish some physically relevant estimates for the dimension of the attractors of the problems. (authors). 28 refs., 1 fig.},

Starting from a well-tested scheme, we show that it is possible to generalize the specification method of the length scales, with no deterioration of the scheme performance in the boundary layer. The new scheme is implemented in a two-dimensional version of a limited-area, numerical model used for the simulation of mesobeta-scale atmospheric flows. Three well-known cases of orographically induced turbulence are studied. The comparison with observations and former studies shows a satisfactory behavior of the new scheme.},

These discrepancies are generally believed not to reflect real differences but rather instrumental shortcomings. In particular, it is clear that flow distortion has not been adequately treated in most previous experiments. In the present paper, results are presented from a surface-layer field experiment where great care was taken to remove any effects from this kind of error and also to minimize other measuring errors. Data from about 90 30-min runs with turbulence measurements at three levels (3, 6, and 14 m) and simultaneous profile data have been analysed to yield information on flux-gradient relationships for wind and temperature.},

	abstract = {Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) is commonly used to model the wind-speed profile at altitudes relevant to wind-power production (e.g. 10–200 m). Though reasonably accurate for unstable to weakly stable stratification, this approach becomes less accurate under increasingly stable stratification, largely due to the constant-flux surface layer assumed by MOST becoming shallower than the altitude range of interest. Furthermore, above the surface layer, the Coriolis force has a considerable influence on the wind-speed profile (in particular in the formation of low-level jets) that cannot be modelled using similarity theory. Our goal is to compare the accuracy of alternative extrapolation models that are more physically appropriate above the surface layer. Using data from the 213-m Cabauw meteorological tower in the Netherlands between July 2007 and June 2008, it is shown that MOST is accurate only at low altitudes and low stability, and breaks down at high altitudes and high stability. Local similarity is generally more accurate than MOST across all altitudes and stabilities, though the model requires turbulent flux data at multiple altitudes that is generally impractical. In contrast, a two-layer MOST–Ekman model is found to be comparable to the other models at low stability ranges and considerably more accurate in the high stability range, while requiring only a measure of surface stability and the geostrophic wind.},
